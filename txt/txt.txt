2022 AUTUMN-WINTER CAMPAIGN
The F/W Collection is a circular turntable set embodying the Earth to show various people with different characteristics.
The peaceful communication and understanding of each other will be shown in this very space.
Each character on the table wears Coor’s collections interpreted in different ways. We invite you on this trip with your imagination.

＇AN UNDEFINED GAZE ‘
F/W Collection ‘An undefined gaze’ was launched, inspired by the films including diverse characters of the millennium.
It contains the heritage items and silhouettes of the time and suggests a new mood by reinterpreting classic materials.
We look forward to seeing Coor being interpreted variously in diverse views and imagination from many different perspectives.
